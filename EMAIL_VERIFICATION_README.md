# Email Verification System

This document explains how the email verification system works in the JustJobsInfo application.

## Overview

The email verification system ensures that users verify their email addresses before they can access the application. This helps prevent spam accounts and ensures valid user registration.

## How It Works

### 1. Registration Process
- When a user registers, a Firebase account is created
- An email verification link is automatically sent to the user's email
- The user is redirected to the login page with a message to check their email

### 2. Email Verification Flow
- User clicks the verification link in their email
- The link contains a special code (`oobCode`) that verifies the email
- User is redirected to `/verify-email` page
- The page processes the verification code and marks the email as verified
- User is redirected to login page after successful verification

### 3. Login Process
- When a user tries to login, the system checks if their email is verified
- If not verified, the user is redirected to the verification page
- The user can request a new verification email if needed

## Files Involved

### Frontend Files
- `src/app/(inner)/register/page.js` - Registration form with email verification
- `src/app/(inner)/login/page.js` - Login form with verification check
- `src/app/(inner)/verify-email/page.js` - Email verification page

### Backend Files
- `src/app/api/auth/resend-verification/route.js` - API for resending verification emails

## Firebase Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```env
# Firebase Client Config
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# Firebase Admin Config (for server-side operations)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_service_account_email
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
```

### Firebase Console Setup
1. Go to Firebase Console > Authentication > Settings
2. Enable "Email verification" in the "User actions" section
3. Configure the email template:
   - **Sender name**: Your app name
   - **From**: noreply@your-project.firebaseapp.com
   - **Subject**: Verify your email for %APP_NAME%
   - **Message**: Customize as needed

## User Experience Flow

    ↓
Verification email sent automatically
    ↓
User signed out and redirected to verification page
    ↓
User checks email and clicks verification link
    ↓
User verifies email and can then login
```

### 2. Email Verification
```
User clicks verification link
    ↓
Redirected to /verify-email?oobCode=xxx
    ↓
Page processes verification code
    ↓
Email marked as verified
    ↓
Success message shown
    ↓
Redirected to login page
```

### 3. Login with Unverified Email
```

    ↓
System checks email verification status
    ↓
If not verified: User signed out and redirected to /verify-email?unverified=true
    ↓
User can request new verification email
    ↓
User verifies email and tries login again
```

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios
1. **Invalid verification link**: Link expired or malformed
2. **User not found**: Account deleted or never existed
3. **Already verified**: User tries to verify already verified email
4. **Network issues**: Failed to send verification email

### Error Messages
- Clear, user-friendly error messages
- Specific guidance for each error type
- Options to retry or get help

## Security Features

### 1. Verification Code Security
- One-time use verification codes
- Time-limited validity (24 hours by default)
- Secure code generation by Firebase

### 2. Rate Limiting
- Firebase automatically limits verification email requests
- Prevents spam and abuse

### 3. Email Validation
- Firebase validates email format
- Prevents invalid email addresses

## Customization Options

### Email Template
You can customize the verification email template in Firebase Console:
- **Subject line**: "Verify your email for %APP_NAME%"
- **Message body**: Include verification link and instructions
- **Sender information**: Configure sender name and email

### Redirect URLs
- After verification: `/login`
- After registration: `/login`
- Verification page: `/verify-email`

### Styling
- Verification page uses custom CSS
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Consistent with app theme

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **New user registration**: Verify email is sent
2. **Email verification**: Verify link works correctly
3. **Login with unverified email**: Verify proper handling
4. **Resend verification**: Verify new email is sent
5. **Invalid verification link**: Verify error handling

### Test Accounts
- Use real email addresses for testing
- Check spam folder for verification emails
- Test with different email providers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Emails not sending**: Check Firebase configuration
2. **Verification links not working**: Check redirect URLs
3. **Users stuck in verification loop**: Check email verification status
4. **Styling issues**: Check CSS classes and responsive design

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Firebase configuration
3. Check email delivery in Firebase Console
4. Test with different browsers and devices

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Email templates**: More customizable email templates
2. **SMS verification**: Add phone number verification
3. **Social login**: Integrate with Google, Facebook, etc.
4. **Advanced security**: Two-factor authentication
5. **Analytics**: Track verification success rates

### Monitoring
- Track verification email delivery rates
- Monitor verification success rates
- Log verification attempts and failures
- Set up alerts for unusual activity
